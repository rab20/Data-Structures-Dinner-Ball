# Data-Structures-Dinner-Ball

## Problem Statement
The BITS â€“ Pilani campus will be hosting its Moon Light Dinner. There would be M boys and N girls at the Moon Light Dinner. Each boy wants a girl who is strictly shorter than him. A girl can dance with only one boy and vice-versa. Given the heights of all the boys and girls tell whether it is possible for all boys to get a girl.

## Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains three lines.
The first line contains M and N.
The second line contains M integers each denoting the height of boy. The third contains N integers each denoting the height of girl.
Ex:
1
45 
2568 
38517

## Output:
Print YES if it is possible for each boy to get a girl else print NO.
YES

## Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N, M<=10000 1<=Height<=200
Explanation:
Combination of (boy, girl) is (2,1), (5,3), (6,5), (8,7). So, there is a possible for all boys to get a girl.
Hence answer is YES.
